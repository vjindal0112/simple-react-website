      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>All you need is a dream in your heart, and an almighty knife. Now we don't want him to get lonely, so we'll give him a little friend. Don't fiddle with it all day.</p>
      <p>You got your heavy coat out yet? It's getting colder. Fluff it up a little and hypnotize it. I guess I'm a little weird. I like to talk to trees and animals. That's okay though; I have more fun than most people. I started painting as a hobby when I was little. I didn't know I had any talent. I believe talent is just a pursued interest. Anybody can do what I do. A fan brush is a fantastic piece of equipment. Use it. Make friends with it. It's almost like something out of a fairytale book.</p>
      <p>We wash our brush with odorless thinner. This piece of canvas is your world. All you have to learn here is how to have fun. Now, we're going to fluff this cloud. This is a happy place, little squirrels live here and play.</p>
      <p>In life you need colors. You can get away with a lot. Let your imagination just wonder around when you're doing these things. Brown is such a nice color. If you don't like it - change it. It's your world.</p>
