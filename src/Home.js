      <h2>Hello World</h2>
      <p>A thin paint will stick to a thick paint. There it is. This is probably the greatest thing to happen in my life - to be able to share this with you. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. Just beat the devil out of it. We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here. If you don't like it - change it. It's your world. Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper.</p>

      <p>In nature, dead trees are just as normal as live trees. We don't need any guidelines or formats. All we need to do is just let it flow right out of us. If there's two big trees invariably sooner or later there's gonna be a little tree. It is a lot of fun. Do an almighty painting with us. Let your imagination just wonder around when you're doing these things. Brown is such a nice color. I spend a lot of time walking around in the woods and talking to trees, and squirrels, and little rabbits and stuff. That's why I paint - because I can create the kind of world I want - and I can make this world as happy as I want it.</p>

      <p>You create the dream - then you bring it into your world. There he comes. You can do it. That's a son of a gun of a cloud. Take your time. Speed will come later. It's life. It's interesting. It's fun. I'll go over the colors one more time that we use: Titanium white, Thalo green, Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown, Alizarin crimson, Sap green, Cad yellow, and Permanent red. Everyone is going to see things differently - and that's the way it should be.</p>

      <p>Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper floating across a mountain. And that's when it becomes fun - you don't have to spend your time thinking about what's happening - you just let it happen. I like to beat the brush. Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. We'll play with clouds today. We have no limits to our world. We're only limited by our imagination. Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be individuals. How do you make a round circle with a square knife? That's your challenge for the day.</p>
